# Harvestify
ML Based agricultural crop recommendation website.
In this project, I present a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation and Plant disease prediction, respectively.

In the crop recommendation application, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.

# Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/code/nirmalgaud/crop-recommendation-system-using-machine-learning/input

# Deployment
the website is yet to be deployed. The project was done by using simple html, css and js.
I expect to further enhance the website with ReactJS.


No thought is yet given to the deployment part. Will update on the progress.
